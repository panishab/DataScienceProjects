## Objective and Scenario
A management consultant is interested in discriminating  between the administrators who are able to complete the task in given time and those who are not.
## Data
The data is taken from (https://www.dropbox.com/s/mihi7xnxrs9qv5r/SystemAdministrators.csv?dl=1) which is provided by the instructor. The data consist of 75 rows and  3 columns. The three columns contain the two dependent variables (Training and Experience) and one independent variable(Completed task which is either Yes or NO).
## Sloved Questions:
1.  Exploratory Data Analysis was done
2.  Run a discriminant analysis for  entire datasets for training with both predictors.
3.  Finds a misclassified percentage of administrators  who completed a task.
4.  computed a decison funtion(classification score) and class probabilities for new administrators who had 4 month experience and 6 credits of training.
5.  Then, again, partion the data into training and testing sets andrun a discriminant and Neural net.
6.  Compare their findings.
## Findings
The training score of Discriminant analysis is  grater than Neural net and while validation score is greater of Neural nets.
